# Stable Diffusion

The repository is for creating a micro AI app for Stable Diffusion with the [Hugging Face Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) library.
We used [VESSL Run](https://medium.com/vessl-ai/introducing-vessl-run-a-unified-yaml-interface-for-running-any-ai-models-ca449b0d5158) for the infrastructure and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the interface layer. 

You can try the app with our Quickstart command. 
```
pip install vessl
vessl hello
```

You can also run it using the YAML file we prepared.
```
vessl run create -f stable-diffusion.yaml
```

Sign up for a free VESSL account and follow along our [tutorial]() to deploy your own app with VESSL Run.
