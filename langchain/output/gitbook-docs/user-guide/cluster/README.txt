# Cluster

A cluster is a set of nodes connected to VESSL that runs containerized machine learning workloads. You can either use VESSLâ€™s managed clusters, or bring your own on-premise or cloud cluster. VESSL provides number of useful cluster management features for the clusters plugged in:

* Running VESSL-managed, fault-tolerant ML workloads on the clusters
* Monitoring & tracking system metrics for cluster, nodes and workloads
* Watching cluster health and issue notifications, e.g. network failure or disk pressure
* Managing resource spec and quota for resource governance across multiple teams & users
