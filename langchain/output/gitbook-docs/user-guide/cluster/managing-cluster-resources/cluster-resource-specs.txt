# Cluster Resource Specs

A **resource spec** of a cluster is **custom presets for resource usage** to achieve standardized resource usage of ML workloads. It prevents unbalanced resource requests from workloads which causes skewed resource usage.

To create and manage resource specs on the cluster, go to **"Settings"** tab on the cluster management page and select **"Resource Specs"** sidebar.
