# Model Registry

A **model registry** is a centralized space for managing model versions. Model governance and security are strengthened by securing an independent space separated from code or dataset. You can collaborate with organization members by monitoring model status and performance.

### Managing model on Web Console

To view and manage model repositories and a list of versioned models, click **MODELS** on the web console.
