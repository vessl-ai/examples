# Overview

## Conceptual Overview

With VESSL, machine learning researchers can run experiments and deploy models on Kubernetes clusters without any background in software engineering or DevOps. A typical workflow on VESSL is composed of 5 steps:

1. Allocate machine resource according to the needs of the Project.&#x20;
2. Import project source code from GitHub.
3. Upload a dataset from local disk or cloud vendors.
4. Run experiments and use Sweep to find the optimal hyperparameter.&#x20;
5. Deploy models into production as REST APIs.
