# CLI

You can invoke the VESSL command-line interface using `vessl` (or `vsl` for short). Use the `--help` flag to get more information about each command.

If you do not provide certain required values, VESSL will inquire these values interactively by default. If you wish to turn off this feature, use the `--no-interaction` flag.&#x20;

To use most CLI commands, you should first create an organization (and a project). For example, to view your datasets, you must specify an organization in your command. To create an experiment, you must specify your project. You can do so by using the `--organization` and `--project` options. For commands with unspecified organization and project, VESSL will use the default settings. You can change your default organization at any time.&#x20;
